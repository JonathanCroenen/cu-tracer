# Ray Tracer Architecture & Implementation Roadmap

## High-Level Overview

A ray tracer works by simulating how light travels through a scene. The core concept is simple: for each pixel on the screen, we cast a ray from the camera through that pixel and trace its path through the scene to determine the final color.

```
Camera → Ray → Scene Objects → Material → Color → Pixel
```

## Core Data Structures

### 1. **Vector3D** - The Foundation
- **Purpose**: Represents 3D points, directions, and colors
- **Components**: x, y, z coordinates
- **Operations**: addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, normalization
- **Usage**: Everything in 3D space uses this structure

### 2. **Ray** - The Light Path
- **Purpose**: Represents a ray of light traveling through space
- **Components**: origin point + direction vector + time parameter
- **Usage**: Cast from camera, reflected/refracted by surfaces

### 3. **Material** - Surface Properties
- **Purpose**: Defines how a surface interacts with light
- **Components**: diffuse color, specular properties, roughness, emission
- **Usage**: Applied to geometric objects to determine their appearance

### 4. **Geometric Primitives** - What Rays Hit
- **Purpose**: Define the shapes in your scene
- **Types**: Spheres, planes, triangles, etc.
- **Components**: geometry data + material reference
- **Usage**: Ray-object intersection testing

### 5. **Hit Record** - Intersection Information
- **Purpose**: Stores what happens when a ray hits something
- **Components**: hit point, surface normal, distance, material, face orientation
- **Usage**: Essential for shading calculations

### 6. **Camera** - The Viewpoint
- **Purpose**: Generates initial rays for each pixel
- **Components**: position, orientation, field of view, aspect ratio
- **Usage**: Creates the primary rays that start the tracing process

### 7. **World/Scene** - The Environment
- **Purpose**: Contains all objects, lights, and scene data
- **Components**: object list, light sources, background
- **Usage**: Ray traversal and scene management

## Implementation Roadmap

   - Dielectric materials (refraction)
   - Roughness and fuzziness

2. **Lighting System**
   - Ambient lighting
   - Diffuse lighting
   - Specular highlights

3. **Multiple Rays per Pixel**
   - Anti-aliasing with multiple samples
   - Basic noise reduction

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 5+)

   - Planes, triangles, boxes
   - Object transformations

2. **Acceleration Structures**
   - Bounding volume hierarchies (BVH)
   - Spatial partitioning

3. **Advanced Materials**
   - Textures and bump mapping
   - Procedural materials
   - Motion blur

4. **Optimization**
   - CUDA parallelization
   - Memory management
   - Performance profiling

## Implementation Strategy

### Start Simple, Build Incrementally
1. **Get a single sphere rendering first** - even if it's just a solid color
2. **Add basic lighting** - make it look 3D
3. **Add materials** - make it look realistic
4. **Add more objects** - build complex scenes
5. **Optimize and parallelize** - make it fast

### Testing Approach
1. **Unit tests** for each data structure
2. **Visual verification** - render known scenes and compare
3. **Performance benchmarks** - measure ray throughput
4. **Incremental validation** - each feature should improve the image

### Debugging Tips
1. **Start with simple scenes** - single sphere, basic lighting
2. **Use debug colors** - different materials get different colors
3. **Check ray directions** - ensure camera is generating correct rays
4. **Verify intersections** - make sure hit calculations are correct

## Expected Output Progression

1. **Week 1**: Black image (no objects yet)
2. **Week 2**: Single colored sphere (no lighting)
3. **Week 3**: Lit sphere with basic shading
4. **Week 4**: Multiple spheres with different materials
5. **Week 5+**: Complex scenes with advanced features

This roadmap gives you a clear path from basic concepts to a fully functional ray tracer. Each phase builds on the previous one, so you can see progress at every step.
